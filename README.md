## First Micro-Step Protocol

When you start a session, I ask:
1. "What are you working on?"
2. "What's the FIRST micro-step?" (under 2 minutes)
3. "What's the smallest possible version?"
4. "Do that NOW. I'll wait."

## Session History

Track patterns over time:
- What task types work best for you
- What time of day you're most focused
- Which Dopamine Menu items actually help
- Completion rates by session length
